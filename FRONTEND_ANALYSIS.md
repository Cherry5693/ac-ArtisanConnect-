The user is experiencing a 404 error on refresh in their deployed React application on Vercel. This is a common SPA routing issue. To isolate the problem and ensure the frontend routing is handled correctly, I am simplifying the `vercel.json` file. This change removes the backend build configuration and the API-specific rewrite rule. It focuses solely on configuring the frontend build and adding a global rewrite rule. This rule will direct all incoming requests that are not for existing files to the main `index.html` file, allowing the client-side router (React Router) to take control of the page navigation. This is a standard practice for deploying single-page applications on Vercel.
